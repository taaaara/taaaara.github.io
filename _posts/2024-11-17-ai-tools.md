# AI Tools

My friens and I found some AI tools for generating character images such as Dall-E, remover.bg, Artbreeder, and Midjourney.Dall-E is a AI tool that openai made in January 2021 and this tool is very useful in generating images. You describe the image that you want and type it. When people use it, this AI tool genrates 1 or 2 images. This is a tool that you have to pay for. Otherwise this is a good tool for generating pictures. This is a 5/5 rate. Remover.bg is a AI tool that erases the background of the charaters. This is a 4/5 rate. Artbreeder is a tool that generates images and is free to use when you sign up. This is a 3.5/5 rate. Midjourney is not free but gives tokens each 24 hours. Each search uses up 5 tokens. This is a 4.5/5 rate. Of all I think in my opinion Dall-E is the best AI tool.
