## No Hunger Description
![No Hunger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taaaara/Python-Basic/main/1.png)
I made a game about sdgs number 2 which is zero hunger. When the player clicks the bread and the poor, they get "Thank You Points".When the player gets 20 "Thank You Points" the picture moves on to a world without hunger.

I wanted to solve the sdgs number 2. I saw many ads that showed kids from Africa and India starving. Something I learned was using Chat GPT more usefully inmy project. Some tools that I used were Chat GPT, Canva, and Python Streamlit.
