# My Summer Vacation in Hawaii

## Day 1 – Arrival at Big Island  
We went to the beach and saw **three wild sea turtles**! It was amazing.

## Day 2–3 – Stomach Flu  
Unfortunately, I got a stomach flu and had to stay in the hotel for two days.  
During that time, my mom and brother also got sick.

## Day 4 – Mauna Kea Sunset  
We felt better and visited the **highest mountain** in Big Island to see the sunset and stars. The view was beautiful.

## Day 5 – Flight to Oahu  
We rode a plane from Big Island to **Oahu**, another island in Hawaii.

## Day 6 – Beach Day  
We went to the beach again. I didn’t see many fish, but the **waves were perfect for boogie boarding**!

## Day 7 – Polynesian Cultural Center  
We took a tour of the whole **Cultural Center**.  
After the tour, we watched a show called **"Hā"**, which means *fire*.  
It felt like watching **Moana 1.5** — so cool!

## Day 8 – Kualoa Ranch  
We went to **Kualoa Ranch** and rode a UTV for a tour of the area.

## Day 9 – Snorkeling  
We went to a **famous snorkeling point**, but didn’t see many fish this time.

## Day 10 – Returning Home  
Time to go home — we flew back to Korea after a memorable trip.

Even though I got sick, it was still an awesome trip!
