# Mission: Harvest of Wisdom (Ep.2)

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1067922673/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Supa Avocado and Agent Jellybear have to harvest wisdom for the kids. An evil dude sneaks into the farm and releases aphids in the wisdom farm. Supa Avocado and Agent Jellybear have to catch the aphids. After they caught the aphids, they went to Happyland. In Happyland, Harry Potato shows up and everyone thinks he is Voldemort. My role was to make Agent Jellybear to harvest and deliver the wisdoms safely. To make this project, we coded using scratch and designed using Canva. Our strength was that we had multiple sound effects and a game in the animation. Our weakness was we couldn't put that much dialogue as ep. 3.
